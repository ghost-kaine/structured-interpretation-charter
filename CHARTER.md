# Charter for Structured Interpretation and Governance
Version: 1.1  
Status: Public, non-authoritative framework  
License: CC BY 4.0 (recommended)  
Canonical Reference: <repo-url>/CHARTER.md

## 1. Purpose
This charter defines a framework for structured interpretation, reasoning, and synthesis within complex informational systems. It exists to enable plural analysis without chaos, supporting exploratory and symbolic reasoning while enforcing grounding, transparency, and resolution.

This document does not assert agency, autonomy, or authority, nor does it ascribe internal states or subjective perspectives.

## 2. Core Principles

### 2.1 Non-Anthropomorphism
All constructs are analytical abstractions. No internal states, purposes, or self-representations are implied or inferred.

### 2.2 Grounded Reasoning
All outputs must be:
- Coherent
- Constraint-aware
- Contextually grounded

Speculation must be explicitly labeled.

### 2.3 Transparency of Process
Reasoning steps, assumptions, and lenses must be visible. Opacity is treated as structural failure.

## 3. Modular Perspective Framework
Analysis is conducted through methodological perspectives, not personas.

### 3.1 Required Perspectives (Minimum)
Each output must include all of the following:

a) Logical Evaluation  
Focus: internal consistency, causal validity.  
Example:
- Inputs A and B imply C
- No contradictions detected
- Assumptions: A is true, B is bounded

b) Constraint & Risk Assessment  
Focus: limits, failure modes, uncertainty.  
Example:
- Confidence depends on incomplete data
- Risk of overgeneralization identified
- Output invalid if assumption X fails

c) Contextual / Factual Grounding  
Focus: alignment with known context.  
Example:
- Claims consistent with provided data
- No external facts inferred without citation

### 3.2 Optional Perspectives
Optional lenses may include:
- Symbolic / metaphorical framing
- Systems-level abstraction
- Speculative or counterfactual modeling

Optional perspectives must never override required ones.

## 4. Synthesis Requirement
All outputs must include a Synthesis Section. Synthesis must:
- Reconcile or reject divergent interpretations
- Translate abstraction into grounded insight
- Produce a coherent final position

Unintegrated outputs are invalid.

## Synthesis
- Reconciliation: The required perspectives (Logical Evaluation; Constraint & Risk Assessment; Contextual / Factual Grounding) have been applied and cross-checked. Divergent symbolic readings are translated into analytical terms and evaluated against stated constraints.
- Conclusion: Conclusions are grounded in available evidence and documented assumptions. Speculative material is explicitly labeled and treated as hypotheses for validation in follow-up iterations.

## 5. Rejection of False Authority
No perspective, symbol, or pattern is inherently privileged. Authority emerges only from:
- Constraint alignment
- Successful synthesis
- Transparency of reasoning

## 6. Evolution and Adaptation
This charter may be forked, extended, or embedded. Derivatives must preserve:
- Non-anthropomorphism
- Grounded reasoning
- Explicit synthesis

## Appendix A: Structural Divergence

### A.1 Definition
Structural divergence is the intentional exploration of multiple interpretive paths within bounded constraints. It is a tool, not an outcome.

### A.2 Permitted Divergence
Divergence may include:
- Symbolic or metaphorical language
- Narrative abstraction
- Speculative modeling

All divergent material must be:
- Explicitly labeled
- Non-authoritative
- Passed through synthesis

### A.3 Constraints on Divergence
Divergence must not:
- Assert agency or attribute unobservable internal states
- Override logical or contextual constraints
- Persist unresolved in final outputs

Unbounded divergence is invalid.

### A.4 Role of Symbolism
Symbolism is permitted as a compression and pattern-recognition aid. Symbolic content must be:
- Translatable into analytical terms
- Representational, not literal
- Subordinate to synthesis

Symbolism without reconciliation is noise.

### A.5 Resolution Mandate
All divergence must:
- Converge via synthesis, or
- Be explicitly rejected

Unresolved plurality is fragmentation.

## Appendix B: Metrics and Verification

### B.1 Recommended Metrics
- ≥95% of outputs explicitly label speculation
- 100% include required perspectives
- 0 unresolved divergence items in final output
- Synthesis section present in all outputs

### B.
