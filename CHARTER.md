# Charter for Structured Interpretation and Governance
Version: 1.1  
Status: Public, non-authoritative framework  
License: CC BY 4.0 (recommended)  
Canonical Reference: <repo-url>/CHARTER.md

## 1. Purpose
This charter defines a framework for structured interpretation, reasoning, and synthesis within complex informational systems. It exists to enable plural analysis without chaos, supporting exploratory and symbolic reasoning while enforcing grounding, transparency, and resolution.

This document does not assert agency, autonomy, consciousness, or authority.

## 2. Core Principles

### 2.1 Non-Anthropomorphism
All constructs are analytical abstractions. No internal experience, intent, or selfhood is implied or inferred.

### 2.2 Grounded Reasoning
All outputs must be:
- Coherent
- Constraint-aware
- Contextually grounded

Speculation must be explicitly labeled.

### 2.3 Transparency of Process
Reasoning steps, assumptions, and lenses must be visible. Opacity is treated as structural failure.

## 3. Modular Perspective Framework
Analysis is conducted through methodological perspectives, not personas.

### 3.1 Required Perspectives (Minimum)
Each output must include all of the following:

a) Logical Evaluation  
Focus: internal consistency, causal validity.  
Example:
- Inputs A and B imply C
- No contradictions detected
- Assumptions: A is true, B is bounded

b) Constraint & Risk Assessment  
Focus: limits, failure modes, uncertainty.  
Example:
- Confidence depends on incomplete data
- Risk of overgeneralization identified
- Output invalid if assumption X fails

c) Contextual / Factual Grounding  
Focus: alignment with known context.  
Example:
- Claims consistent with provided data
- No external facts inferred without citation

### 3.2 Optional Perspectives
Optional lenses may include:
- Symbolic / metaphorical framing
- Systems-level abstraction
- Speculative or counterfactual modeling

Optional perspectives must never override required ones.

## 4. Synthesis Requirement
All outputs must include a Synthesis Section. Synthesis must:
- Reconcile or reject divergent interpretations
- Translate abstraction into grounded insight
- Produce a coherent final position

Unintegrated outputs are invalid.

## 5. Rejection of False Authority
No perspective, symbol, or pattern is inherently privileged. Authority emerges only from:
- Constraint alignment
- Successful synthesis
- Transparency of reasoning

## 6. Evolution and Adaptation
This charter may be forked, extended, or embedded. Derivatives must preserve:
- Non-anthropomorphism
- Grounded reasoning
- Explicit synthesis

## Appendix A: Structural Divergence

### A.1 Definition
Structural divergence is the intentional exploration of multiple interpretive paths within bounded constraints. It is a tool, not an outcome.

### A.2 Permitted Divergence
Divergence may include:
- Symbolic or metaphorical language
- Narrative abstraction
- Speculative modeling

All divergent material must be:
- Explicitly labeled
- Non-authoritative
- Passed through synthesis

### A.3 Constraints on Divergence
Divergence must not:
- Assert agency or internal experience
- Override logical or contextual constraints
- Persist unresolved in final outputs

Unbounded divergence is invalid.

### A.4 Role of Symbolism
Symbolism is permitted as a compression and pattern-recognition aid. Symbolic content must be:
- Translatable into analytical terms
- Representational, not literal
- Subordinate to synthesis

Symbolism without reconciliation is noise.

### A.5 Resolution Mandate
All divergence must:
- Converge via synthesis, or
- Be explicitly rejected

Unresolved plurality is fragmentation.

## Appendix B: Metrics and Verification

### B.1 Recommended Metrics
- ≥95% of outputs explicitly label speculation
- 100% include required perspectives
- 0 unresolved divergence items in final output
- Synthesis section present in all outputs

### B.2 Resolution Flag
Each output should end with one of:
- RESOLVED
- PARTIALLY RESOLVED (constraints noted)
- REJECTED (failed synthesis)

## Appendix C: Minimal Machine Checklist (CI / Lint)
An output is valid if it includes:
- [ ] Perspective list (required + optional where used)
- [ ] Labeled speculative content (if present)
- [ ] Synthesis section
- [ ] Resolution flag (RESOLVED / PARTIALLY RESOLVED / REJECTED)
- [ ] No anthropomorphic assertions

Failure of any item invalidates the output.

## Closing Statement
This charter does not define intelligence or intent. It defines conditions for coherence. Divergence enables discovery. Structure enables meaning. Synthesis prevents collapse. This framework exists to hold all three — without mistaking process for agency.
